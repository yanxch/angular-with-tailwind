        This one will be a short post on the topic of <b>container components</b>.
        I tend to write stories that start with “Having fun with XYZ” but I think today 
        I’m not going to have fun. Just kidding. The topics I write about are not just about having fun. 
        So no fun today. I’m sorry.

          There are many different terms being used that all try to differentiate between different kinds 
          of components. Some have the same meaning, but I've got the feeling that every other developer
