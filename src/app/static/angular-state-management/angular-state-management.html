            Many people rant about the boilerplate that is produced when introducing a redux based state management library in an Angular application. 
            All I can respond to that is:

            Though, I can understand those people, they are right in some way.

            There are many different terms being used that all try to differentiate between different kinds
            of components. Some have the same meaning, but I've got the feeling that every other developer
            has a little different view on their intended behavior. Let’s gather the terms:
